# Team Contract

**Your team is free to revise this contract as your team wishes; we have scaffolded it with a recommended structure similar to the provided sample on Quercus.**

After you reflect on past teamwork experiences and brainstorm a list of actions required for a positive teamwork experience, answer these questions. 

Once you have all agreed on the contents of the team contract, make a PR to merge your team contract into the main branch of your team's repo on GitHub.

**Please remember to remove any of the initial instruction text when your team finalizes your team contract; it should resemble the provided sample once complete, but with details specific to the expectations and norms agreed to by your entire team.**

## Purpose of this Contract

This contract sets out shared expectations and commitments for how our team will collaborate during the course. It is designed to promote accountability, professionalism, and mutual support as we complete individual preparation, readiness assurance tests, in-class activities, and our course project.

## Team Norms and Expectations

### Communication

* Which platform will you use for communication outside of class, when required for work on your course project? (Examples: Text message, Discord, WeChat, etc.)
* **We will use Instagram for communication outside of class**

* Each teammate agrees to respond to messages in at most how long? 1 day? 2 days? Some other amount of time?
* **Typically within one day of a message being sent**

* What things should a teammate notify you about? (Examples: if they think they won't be able to meet a deadline, if they have to miss lecture, etc.)
* **Teammates should notify other teammates about any complications that will affect the group (as the aforementioned deadline issues or attendance issues)**

* Respectful and inclusive behaviour are necessary for smooth and productive communication. What are some respectful and inclusive behaviours you expect when communicating with each other during lectures, labs, or outside of class? (Examples: Actively listening to each team members ideas, giving everyone a chance to meaningfully contribute, etc.)
* **As a team, we will try to compromise and feasibly incorporate all team members ideas and suggestions. This of course includes actively listening to each other ideas, allowing others a chance to contribute to the discussion or problem, as well as ensuring that all of us are on a mutual ground (that is, no bad blood between any member)**

### [Other Categories of norms and expectations go here]

* Based on your previous teamwork experiences, what other behaviours do you agree upon as a team?
    - some examples of possible additional team norms and expectations are included in the sample team contract in case your team needs some help getting ideas for what else you want to include.
    - **Always respond to other team members/Maintain proper communication**
    - **Ask others for assistance if stuck**
    - **Evenly distribute work so that no one person is doing all/most of the work**
    - **Be honest and don't make excuses in bad faith to the rest of the time**

---

## Decision Making

* How will decisions about your team project be made? (Examples: By majority vote, by unanimous vote, etc.)
* **By majority vote**

---
## Conflict resolution

* How will your team resolve conflicts? (Example: by listening to each other's side of the issue and attempting to reach a compromise. By consulting a TA or instructor as a team, if a resolution has not yet been reached.)
* **Sufficient discussion and reaching a compromise that all members are satisfied with. If not possible/difficult, look to an external source to resolve conflict or find inspiration to a solution for us**

---

## Accountability

* Reliability and accountability are also important aspects of teamwork. What are the responsibilities of each team member? (Example: completing their share of the work in a timely manner, seeking assistance from teammates/TAs/instructors when required, etc.)
* **As mentioned earlier, each team member is expected to be fully accountable for their share of work, so each member should complete their individual tasks by an agreed upon time, and if there are any complications towards completing the task then they should look for resolutions via reaching out to other team members or reaching out to trustworthy sources to help resolve the complication (so like go to a TA or Instructor first before running to AI and having it have its way with our code)**
